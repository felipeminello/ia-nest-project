## Coding Style
Use camelCase for all variable names and prefer arrow functions over traditional function expressions.
Using `const` and `let` is mandatory; avoid `var`. Always use template literals for string interpolation.
Using SOLID principles is highly encouraged. Follow the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle to minimize code duplication.
Adhere to consistent indentation and ensure to document your code thoroughly.
Using Clean Architecture principles is highly encouraged to maintain a well-structured codebase.
Utilize NestJS libraries and features to their fullest extent to ensure consistency and leverage the framework's capabilities.

## Testing
We use Jest for unit testing. Generate unit tests in a separate `*.test.ts` file.
